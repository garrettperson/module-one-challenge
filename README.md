# module-one-challenge

## Description

My motivation in this project was to refactor existing code to make it more accessible.

I built this project to make the existing website more accessible, especially for those users using screen readers.

This project solves the problem of the website being inaccessible for some users and thus it has become more optimized for search engines.

I learned more about more about accessibility by completing this project. 

The principle changes include 'alt' tags describing all but one of the images, and the last image is described via comments in the html code. 

The html has been altered such that the non-semantic elements (i.e. <div>) have been replaced by semantic elements, including <section>. 

The CSS has been consolidated, removing multiple lines of code that repeat themselves and grouping them into fewer lines of code that pertain to multiple elements. The CSS is less repetitive. 

All changes within the code have been noted via comments.

## Usage

The new code behaves mostly the same as the old code. The clickable interactions at the top of the page continue to function the same, and now the "Search Engine Optimization" button functions, directing the user to the correct place on the page. A new feature is that all but one of the pictures has an 'alt' tag describing the picture to the user, making the page optimized for screen readers and search engines.
