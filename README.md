# module-one-challenge

## Description

My motivation in this project was to refactor existing code to make it more accessible.

I built this project to make the existing website more accessible, especially for those users using screen readers.

This project solves the problem of the website being inaccessible for some users and thus it has become more optimized for search engines.

I learned more about more about accessibility by completing this project.
